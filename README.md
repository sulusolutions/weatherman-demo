# Lightning Weather App

## ⚡ Introduction

This Lightning Weather App is a cutting-edge demonstration of the L402 API's capabilities, showcasing how the Lightning Network can power applications. This project stands as a testament to an evolving digital economy where products can thrive without traditional advertising or data harvesting models. By leveraging the L402 APIs, this app offers a glimpse into a future where user experience and privacy are paramount.

## 🎯 Purpose

The core purpose of this project is to illustrate the potential of the Lightning Network's L402 APIs in creating native applications that prioritize user privacy and a seamless user experience. Our Lightning Weather App is a prime example of a product that operates independently of advertising revenue or invasive data collection practices. It serves as a blueprint for developers looking to build innovative, user-centric applications on the Lightning Network.

## 💻 Technologies

This app leverages the power of L402 APIs through a variety of technologies:

- **L402**: L402, developed by Lightning Labs, is a protocol that enables the monetization of APIs through the Lightning Network. It was developed by Lightning Labs, a pioneer in the development of the Lightning Network, is committed to creating scalable, fast, low-cost, and privacy-preserving public blockchains. Read more about L402 [here](https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402).

- **Sulu**: Monetizing APIs with L402 can be complicated. [Sulu](https://www.sulu.sh) is a platform that enables API providers to seamlessly implement API monetization for their endpoints. They also provide SDKs and technology to consume and operate with these APIs.

- **Alby**: [Alby](https://getalby.com/) brings Bitcoin to the web with easy-to-use browser extensions, facilitating seamless transactions and interactions within the Lightning Network. By integrating Alby, our app demonstrates a simple yet powerful way for users to interact with Lightning Network services directly from their browsers. 

- **WebLN**: WebLN is a standard for web-based Lightning Network applications that enables client-side Lightning payments and identity management. Our use of WebLN in the Lightning Weather App exemplifies how developers can create more interactive and user-friendly experiences with the Lightning Network.

## 🌊 Promoting a New Wave of Development

The Lightning Weather App is more than just a weather forecast tool. It's a harbinger for a new era of application development. It paves the way for products that are free from the constraints of conventional monetization strategies, empowering developers to create with the user's best interests in mind.

## 🤝 Get Involved

We encourage developers, enthusiasts, and visionaries to explore the Lightning Weather App, delve into its code, and consider how the Lightning Network can be the foundation of your next project.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 🐝 Consuming L402 Endpoints with Alby

To consume L402 endpoints using Alby, you can use the `fetchWithL402` function from the `@getalby/lightning-tools` package. This function allows you to make requests to L402 endpoints and handle the payment process seamlessly.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```javascript
import { fetchWithL402 } from "@getalby/lightning-tools";

const fetchWeather = async (city: string) => {
    try {
        const formatted_city = city.replace(/\s/g, '');
        const response = await fetchWithL402(`https://weatherman.ln.sulu.sh/current?city=${formatted_city}`, 
        {}, 
        {headerKey: "L402"})

        const { current } = await response.json();

        // Process the response data...
    } catch (err) {
        // Handle error...
    }
};
```

In this example, `fetchWithL402` is used to fetch weather data from an L402 endpoint. The city name is passed as a parameter in the URL. The function returns a promise that resolves with the response of the request.
